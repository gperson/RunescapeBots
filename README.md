RunescapeBots
=============
RuneScape is a fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game, this repository will hold bots for the game created using Sikuli.  Although I probably won't use them and no longer play the game, thought it would be fun to play around with Sikuli and create something 'useful'.

## Setup
1. Fork and clone this project to you machine
2. Download and install SikuliIDE
3. Run/Open the SikuliIDE
4. In Sikuli go to File -> Open... and select the bot you want to run/see

## Running a bot
1. Sign into Runescape
2. Take your character to the location and position them as found {here}.
3. Click run on the SikuliIDE
